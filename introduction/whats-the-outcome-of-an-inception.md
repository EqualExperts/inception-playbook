# What’s the outcome of an Inception?

## **Knowing what to do next and being set up to do it**

As part of an Inception we basically need to answer the following questions:

* What must we achieve, and why? 
* Do we agree that this is a good thing to do?
* How will we achieve this?
* How long will it take and how much will it cost?
* What could possibly go wrong?
* What will we do next \(and then in the mid / long term\)?
* What do we need in place to start

As part of answering these questions we will create a range of artefacts. These will help us with two things:

> ### _An Inception is not waterfall. Nevertheless, some plan and cost will be required to allow the team to know what to do next, manage resourcing and other dependencies, and, of course allow the client to make a cost-value-based judgement call._

## **Making the call: should we proceed?**

A successful inception will give us, sufficient insight to make a decision on whether to:

1. **Continue with the initiative**: Where we decide to continue, an Inception results in a statement of the problem and related solution, as well as the delivery approach and plan.
2. **Pivot**: When we decide to pivot, we may need to run a discovery to validate the new problem statement, and then run a lighter Inception to de-risk delivery.
3. **Stop**: This can often be hard due to the sunk cost fallacy, or good old politics. But sometimes it is the right thing to do. When we decide to stop, it’s a good idea to provide a bit of space for the team to process the implications.

## **If we proceed: Hitting the ground running**

If we decide that it is the right thing to proceed with implementation, we will generally see deliverables covering the following:

* **Goals and scope -** What we will do and why
* **Solution approach -** How the solution will ‘look like’ and how will go about delivering it, covering functional and technological aspects, as well as process and ways of working
* **Risks and dependencies -** Where to be careful
* **Plan and cost -** An expression of when to expect what, and the required capabilities and resources.
* **Playback deck -** A summary of findings and recommendations

These deliverables will be reasonably high level with just enough detail to make the call and shape overall deliver \(with maybe some more detail for the very first iteration so we can get ‘right into it’\).
