## **Doing The right thing and Doing it the right way**

As with anything we do, Inceptions are based on **principles and paradigms** we know make the difference:  


* We validate that our solution is **desirable**, **viable** and **feasible**. Note that we use Discovery to find opportunities and define valid value propositions, but Inceptions to validate and this and find the best way of delivering.
* We deliver the most valuable outcomes when we focus on **problem / opportunity** and **solution / outcomes**.
* We achieve this by applying **product thinking** to focus us on the user; **lean** principles to work efficiently, and **agile** approaches to deliver in an environment of change and uncertainty.
* We gain certainty by formulating **hypotheses** and validate by measuring outcomes.
* We deliver most successfully when all stakeholders are **aligned**, **risks** are identified and mitigated early, and **trust** within the team is high.

> ### _These principles permeate everything we do during Inception – but also during the subsequent delivery and business as usual._

## **The outcome of a successful Inception**

By following these principles, we aim to gain confidence that

* We are doing the right thing
* We will be doing it in the right way
* We know what to do next
* We can hit the ground running
* We have minimised risk as much as possible

We know we have been successful when we proceed with high confidence and ease; we will recognise this early on, but we may also want to periodically review once we are a bit into delivery proper to ensure we are on track and not just ‘bumbling along’.
