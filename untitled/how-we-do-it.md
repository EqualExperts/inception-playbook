# How we do it

## Identify the activities and expected outcomes

While detailed activities are highly contextual to each individual Inception, the overall flow and framework will stay loosely the same. 

When planning Inceptions, we take the blueprint as a starting point, add or remove activities as required and adjust the overall flow for the best-fitting narrative. 

We also define outcomes for each activity, so it’s clear as to why a given activity is being conducted and what the focus is on.

The Inception Agenda Blueprint outlines a generic starting point. Alternatively the Example Schedule can be used.

### Pro tips

{% hint style="success" %}
Inceptions can be run for any type of initiative, not only product or feature builds. While this playbook focuses on Software Applications, it will work just as well for a change or transformation initiative, but your perspective will be different \(virtual may become bricks and mortar, you may not need wireframes but instead drawings of a future office space\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Clearly articulate why you are doing the activity. What are you trying to achieve? What questions need answering? Remember, good Inceptions are all about actionable outcomes.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
This playbook is about Inception, not Discovery which means we’re concerned with building foundations for a subsequent delivery. Therefore we assume that the rationale for the initiative is sound and articulated \(e.g. business case, value proposition, goals\). We will want to validate and align on this, but would pivot to a Discovery if we found it lacking.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Taking rationale and value proposition as solid does not mean we cannot formulate hypotheses or experiments as part of an Inception or subsequent delivery. Dependent on the initiative, our Inception may result in a very concrete feature list and roadmap, or a backlog of experiments \(or a mix of both\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Inceptions may be run within a known or new domain, with an existing or new client – all of which will affect the Inception activities. Some activities may be skipped – for instance, ways of working if we already have an established team, or detailed analysis if we’re working in a known domain or context \(in which case we may focus on validation instead\). 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Inceptions can be templated and re-used. For one of our clients, we have created a generic Inception schedule to be executed whenever one of their legacy applications is containerised and made cloud-deployment ready.
{% endhint %}

## Identify inputs required for each activity

For each activity we define the information needed to achieve the desired outcomes. We’ve achieved our best results by keeping the level of preparation to sharing expectations and knowledge on where the client wants to go and where they are now, rather than being over-prepared in regards to the solution. The latter can lead to heavy bias and the need to backpedal, thus frustrating stakeholders who came over-prepared.

### Pro tips

{% hint style="success" %}
Let’s be honest: stakeholders rarely have the chance to do homework prior to Inceptions. They are busy people. In any case, the quality of responses to long lists of questions list is rarely as good as having a face to face chat.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Don’t over research. It’s always best to hear it straight from the horse’s mouth.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Be aware that prepared material is often stale, biased, siloed or counter-agile. It can still provide valuable context, but is often better set aside. We often get requirements documents from our clients which we’ll use to prepare and validate against, but often don’t use during the Inception.
{% endhint %}

## Define how to execute each activity

Based on the topic, objective and expected participants, we determine the best way to execute individual activities and which tools and techniques to use. This could be a simple presentation or a workshop using our tools and techniques \(as listed in the Inception Agenda Blueprint, and discussed in detail in the Inception Agenda Design Deep Dive\).

### Pro tips

{% hint style="success" %}
A variety of engagement styles, techniques and tools makes for a more interesting engagement and increases attendees’ motivation and attention spans.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Be confident in the application of the tools you use.
{% endhint %}

## **Define required participants for each activity**

For each activity we identify relevant participants and stakeholders. We focus on cross-disciplinary groups that hold the required knowledge, as well as the authority to make informed decisions.

## **Prepare any materials you will need for each activity**

As with inputs, we are careful to avoid over-preparation \(as it leads to bias and impedes collaboration and buy in\). We simply ensure we’re prepared to drive discussions and analysis, and usually have a bag of tricks in case we need to swerve and pivot.

Once you have your Agenda laid out, you can head right into scheduling and running it.

### **Pro tips**

{% hint style="success" %}
Focus on preparation of the process – not presenting a solution.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Quite often, there’s a limit to how much prep you can do. That’s OK. It’s the Inception’s job to tease out and answer questions, collaboratively – not to critique a solution approach you’ve already prepared with limited context.
{% endhint %}
